As content is released for 1.21.1, it will be added swiftly and seamlessly, all thanks to unification being handled using KubeJS and Almost Unified.</p> <p>World generation should always be kept simple, yet feel fun to explore and traverse through, which is why we have gone with the fan favourite of Biomes o' Plenty. By sticking with one world generation mod, we can offer a clean, efficient world that will not lag you out when your friends explore deeper into the world. This reiterates our commitment to a quality modpack perfect for playing with friends.</p> <p>Evolution 1 | CurseForge | GitHub</p>"}]}
